# Blood-Test-Result-Tracker-Android-App
This is an android app created with android studio and java. It can save a list of different results from a single blood test, with the option for the user to add custom fields. There are also separate profiles, so more than one person's results can be tracked.  You can add, edit and remove blood test records. You can also add or delete profiles entirely. There is also another major component of this app which is the guide to your results. The guide will tell you what each result from your blood test/record is (for example, vitamin-d), and it will tell you what it means to have a certain range or result from that test. You can also compare a select test through multiple records. For example, I can compare my weight or vitamin B-12 through various records created. It allows the user to focus on one result without needing the hassle to find each one individually in each record.
