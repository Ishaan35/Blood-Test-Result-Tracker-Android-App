• This test is used to diagnose hereditary spherocytosis, spontaneous hemolysis, RBC enzyme deficiency and hemolytic anemia.

• This test measures the degree to which patients' red cells lyse without additives, with glucose and with ATP (Adenosine Tri-phosphate). <br>

• Glucose by itself can induce hemolysis in auto hemolysis test in patients with hereditary spherocytosis. Glucose-6-Phosphate dehydrogenase deficient RBC’s have increased auto hemolysis, which corrects significantly with glucose or ATP. Pyruvatekinase deficiency has increased auto-hemolysis, which does not correct or get aggravated with glucose but does correct toward normal with ATP.<br>
