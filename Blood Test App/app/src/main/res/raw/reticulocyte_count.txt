• Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells. A reticulocyte count is a test your doctor can use to measure the level of reticulocytes in your blood. It’s also known as a retic count, corrected reticulocyte count, or reticulocyte index.

• A reticulocyte count can help your doctor learn if your bone marrow is producing enough red blood cells. If your red blood cell count is too low or too high, your body will try to achieve a better balance by producing and releasing more or less reticulocytes. Your doctor can tell whether your body is creating and releasing them properly by ordering a reticulocyte count.

• A reticulocyte count can help your doctor make a diagnosis of a variety of conditions, such as anemia and bone marrow failure. They’ll likely order additional tests to develop their diagnosis.
<br>
<br>
• Your doctor may recommend a reticulocyte count if they want to learn how your bone marrow is functioning, including production of enough red blood cells. They may also order a reticulocyte count to help diagnose and distinguish between different types of anemia.
<br>
<br>
• They may also use it to help monitor your progress and health after you undergo chemotherapy, radiation therapy, a bone marrow transplant, or treatment for iron deficiency anemia.

<b> Results: </b>
<br><br>
    • The results are reported as the percentage of reticulocytes divided by the total number of red blood cells times 100. The reference range, or healthy range, of the reticulocyte percentage in adults is 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent.
    <br>
    <br>
    • High reticulocyte  levels can be a sign of acute bleeding, chronic blood loss, hemolytic anemia, kidney disease, or erythroblastosis fetalis (also called hemolytic disease in a newborn, a potentially fatal blood disorder that affects some fetuses and newborns)
    <br>
    <br>
    • Low reticulocyte levels could indicate: iron deficiency anemia, aplastic anemia, folic acid deficiency, vitamin B-12 deficiency, bone marrow failure caused by infection, or cancer, kidney disease, cirrhosis, side effects from radiation therapy
