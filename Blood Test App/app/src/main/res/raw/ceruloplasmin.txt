<b> Normal Range: </b>
<br>
    • The normal range for a ceruloplasmin serum test is: 20 - 35 mg/dL

<br>
<br>

<b>Lower </b> levels of ceruloplasmin can indicate:
<br>
<br>
 • Chronic liver disease <br>
 • Intestinal malabsorption <br>
 • Wilson copper storage disease (rare)<br>
 • Malnutrition <br>
 • Menkes' syndrome (rare) <br>

<br>

<br><b>Higher </b> levels of ceruloplasmin can indicate:
<br>
<br>
 • Acute infection <br>
 • Chronic infection <br>
 • Leukemia<br>
 • Pregnancy<br>
