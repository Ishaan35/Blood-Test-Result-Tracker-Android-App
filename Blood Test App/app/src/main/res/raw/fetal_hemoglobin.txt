• A fetal hemoglobin test is a blood test that checks the amount of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) in the blood. Fetal hemoglobin is one of many types of hemoglobin. It is present in high levels in fetuses, but usually drops to trace amounts about six months after birth. If Hb F is at higher than normal levels, it can mean you have thalassemia, myeloid leukemia, or sickle cell anemia.

• You may need this test if your healthcare provider suspects that you have a blood disorder related to a high level of fetal hemoglobin in your blood. People with most of these disorders don't have symptoms but may have varying degrees of anemia. Symptoms related to anemia can include fatigue, pain, irregular heartbeat, and other heart problems. The disorders are genetic, so your healthcare provider may also recommend this test if you have a family history of the disease.
