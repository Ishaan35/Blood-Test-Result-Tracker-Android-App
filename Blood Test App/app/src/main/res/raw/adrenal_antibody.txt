• An anti-adrenal antibody screen is prescribed to assess the presence or risk of developing adrenal gland failure (insufficiency).

• The adrenal glands are two small glands each located above the kidneys. These glands are composed of two parts: an external part called the “adrenal cortex” and a central part called the “adrenal medulla.” The adrenal cortex is responsible for producing several hormones important for human health, such as cortisol and corticosterone, which affect the body’s response to stress (infections, surgeries, burns, hypoglycemia, etc.), and aldosterone, which is strongly involved in controlling blood pressure. The adrenal cortex also produces androgens (masculinizing hormones).

• When the immune system produces antibodies against the adrenal cortex, it leads to adrenal insufficiency, also called Addison’s disease. This disorder is most often caused by the presence of these anti-adrenal antibodies. Often, the presence of anti-adrenal antibodies is the only detectable autoimmune disorder, but sometimes, it is part of a combination of other autoimmune disorders (hypothyroidism, pernicious anemia, type 1 diabetes, etc.).

• Your doctor may recommend a reticulocyte count if they want to learn how your bone marrow is functioning, including production of enough red blood cells. They may also order a reticulocyte count to help diagnose and distinguish between different types of anemia.

• They may also use it to help monitor your progress and health after you undergo chemotherapy, radiation therapy, a bone marrow transplant, or treatment for iron deficiency anemia.

    • A positive anti-adrenal antibody (or anti-21-hydroxylase) result indicates the presence of adrenal antibodies compatible with active or developing Addison’s disease.
