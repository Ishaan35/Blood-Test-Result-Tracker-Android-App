• Lipase is an enzyme primarily produced by the pancreas to help digest dietary fats. This test measures the amount of lipase in the blood.

  The pancreas is a narrow, flat organ about six inches long located deep within the abdominal cavity, below the liver and between the stomach and the spine. Its head section connects to the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. Inside the pancreas, small ducts (tubes) feed digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas into the pancreatic duct. Lipase is transported through the pancreatic duct and into the first part of the small intestine, where it helps break down dietary triglycerides (a form of fat) into fatty acids.

• Lipase is usually present in the blood in small quantities. When cells in the pancreas are injured, increased amounts of lipase enter the blood and result in higher concentrations in the blood. This can occur in conditions such as pancreatitis, or when the pancreatic duct is blocked by a gallstone or, in rare cases, by a pancreatic tumor.

<b> Ranges: </b>

    • Normal:  0-160 U/L <br>
    • Pancreatitis suspected:  > 200 U/L <br>

<b> Causes of high lipase: </b> <br>
<br>
    • Pancreatitis - also known as inflammation of the pancreas, can cause amylase and lipase levels to be increased up to 3 times normal. Both values should be increased, in order to carry the diagnosis of pancreatitis. <br>
    • Lipase may be increased in tumors of the pancreas, or stomach certain stomach conditions. These conditions are usually painful. <br>
    • Gall bladder infection - Inflammation of the gall bladder (cholecystitis), may cause increased lipase levels (hyperlipasemia). <br>
    • Kidney failure can cause hyperlipasemia.<br>
    • Your doctor or healthcare provider will diagnose hyperlipasemia by drawing a tube of blood. If there is a suspicion of gall bladder, pancreas or kidney problems, an ultrasound of the gall bladder or pancreas, or a CAT scan of your abdomen, may also be performed.<br> <br>

    • You may be at risk for pancreatitis if you are:<br>
    • Extremely overweight (obese)<br>
    • Have high triglyceride levels in your blood<br>
    • Drink too much alcohol<br>
    • Have been diagnosed with gall bladder stones (which may block the flow of secretions from the pancreas to the intestines) <br>
    • Or have a family history of pancreatitis.<br>
