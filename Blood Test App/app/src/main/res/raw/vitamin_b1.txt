This is why its name carries the number 1. Like the other B vitamins, thiamine is water-soluble and helps the body turn food into energy. You can find it in: foods, individual supplements, or multivitamins.

• Thiamine deficiency is uncommon in the developed world. Thiamine deficiency is rare in healthy adults. It’s more common in people with specific medical conditions. Conditions that can impair thiamine levels include: alcoholism, Crohn’s disease, or anorexia.

• People who are undergoing dialysis for their kidneys or taking loop diuretics are also at risk for thiamine deficiency. Loop diuretics are prescribed for people with congestive heart failure. They can flush thiamine out of the body, possibly canceling out any health benefits. The heart relies on thiamine to function properly. People who take digoxin and phenytoin should also be careful.
