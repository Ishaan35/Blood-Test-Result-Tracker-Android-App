• Amylase is an enzyme present in the human saliva which begins the chemical process of digestion. It helps convert dietary starch into sugars.
<br>
<br>
• Amylase is also present in the pancreas help hydrolyzing the starch in our diet into disaccharides and trisaccharides.
<br>
<br>
<br>

• Amylase tests are ordered in the following cases:  <br>
 • To diagnose acute pancreatitis or other conditions of the pancreas <br>
 • Urine amylase may be done to monitor kidney dysfunction <br>
 • To monitor progress made in pancreatic cancer treatment <br>
 • To monitor progress after removing gallstone <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<b> Normal Range: </b>
<br>
    • The normal range for adults for amylase in a blood sample is 30 to 110 units per liter (U/L)
<br>
<br>

<b>Increased </b> levels of the enzyme can indicate:
<br>
<br>
 • Sudden swelling of the pancreas (acute pancreatitis) <br>
 • Chronic pancreatitis that suddenly gets worse <br>
 • Cancers of the pancreas, breast, colon, ovary, or lung <br>
 • A sore in the pancreas <br>
 • A type of cyst in the pancreas (pancreatic pseudocysts) <br>
 • Swelling in your abdomen (ascites) <br>
 • Macroamylasemia. This is a noncancer (benign) condition marked by having a substance called macroamylase in your blood.  <br>
 • Peptic ulcer that has a hole in it (perforated ulcer) <br>
 • Death of tissue in your intestine (intestinal infarction) <br>
 • Blockage in your intestines <br>
 • Appendicitis <br>
 • Sudden swelling of the gallbladder (acute cholecystitis) <br>
 • Ruptured ectopic pregnancy <br>
 • Salivary gland swelling <br>
 • Swelling of the lining of your abdomen (peritonitis) <br>
 • Burns  <br>
 • Anorexia nervosa and bulimia  <br>
 • Diabetic ketoacidosis  <br>
