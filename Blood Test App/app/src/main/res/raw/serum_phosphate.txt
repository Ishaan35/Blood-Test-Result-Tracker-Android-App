• Phosphorus is an important element that’s vital to several of the body’s physiological processes. It helps with bone growth, energy storage, and nerve and muscle production. Many foods — especially meat and dairy products — contain phosphorus, so it’s usually easy to get enough of this mineral in your diet.<br>
<br>
<br>
• Your bones and teeth contain most of your body’s phosphorus. However, some phosphorous is in your blood. Your doctor can assess your blood phosphorus level using a serum phosphorus test.<br>
<br>
<br>
• Hyperphosphatemia is when you have too much phosphorus in your blood. Hypophosphatemia is the opposite — having too little phosphorus. Various conditions, including chronic alcohol use disorder and vitamin D deficiency, can cause your blood phosphorus level to become too low.<br>
<br>
<br>
• A serum phosphorus test can determine whether you have high or low phosphorus levels, but it can’t help your doctor diagnose the cause of your condition. Your doctor will need to perform more tests to determine what’s causing abnormal serum phosphorus test results.
