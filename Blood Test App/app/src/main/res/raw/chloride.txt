• Chloride is an electrolyte. It is a negatively charged ion that works with other electrolytes, such as potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate, to help regulate the amount of fluid in the body and maintain the acid-base balance. This test measures the level of chloride in the blood and/or urine.

<br>

Why do people get tested?<br> <br>

• To determine if there is a problem with your body's electrolyte balance or acid-base (pH) balance and to monitor treatment; as part of a routine health checkup


<b> Normal Range: </b>
<br>
    • The normal adult value for chloride is 97-107 mEq/L (1000mEq = 1 mL)

<br>
<br>

<b>Decreased </b> levels are caused by:
<br>
<br>
 • Loss of body fluids from prolonged vomiting, diarrhea, sweating or high fevers <br>
 • Drugs such as: bicarbonate, corticosteroids, diuretics, and laxatives <br>
 • Can indicate Hypochloremia (Hypochloremia is an electrolyte imbalance and is indicated by a low level of chloride in the blood.) <br>
<br>
<br>

Hypochloremia symptoms:
<br>
<br>
 • Dehydration, fluid loss, or high levels of blood sodium may be noted.
 • You may be experiencing other forms of fluid loss, such as diarrhea, or vomiting.
