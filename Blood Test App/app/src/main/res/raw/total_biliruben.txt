• This is a blood test that measures the amount of a substance called bilirubin. This test is used to find out how well your liver is working. It is often given as part of a panel of tests that measure liver function. A small amount of bilirubin in your blood is normal, but a high level may be a sign of liver disease.<br>
<br>
• The liver makes bile to help you digest food, and bile contains bilirubin. Most bilirubin comes from the body's normal process of breaking down old red blood cells. A healthy liver can normally get rid of bilirubin. But when you have liver problems, bilirubin can build up in your body to unhealthy levels. <br>
<br>
• Bilirubin results depend on your age, gender, and health. Adults with jaundice generally have bilirubin levels greater than 2.5 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). In an otherwise healthy newborn, bilirubin levels greater than 20 to 25 mg/dL may cause problems.<br>
