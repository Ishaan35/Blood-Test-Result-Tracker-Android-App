• A white blood cell (WBC) count is a test that measures the number of white blood cells in your body. This test is often included with a complete blood count (CBC). The term “white blood cell count” is also used more generally to refer to the number of white blood cells in your body.<br>
<br>

• There are several types of white blood cells, and your blood usually contains a percentage of each type. Sometimes, however, your white blood cell count can fall or rise out of the healthy range.<br>
<br>
Having a higher or lower number of WBCs than normal may indicate an underlying condition. A WBC count can detect hidden infections within your body and alert doctors to undiagnosed medical conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, immune deficiencies, and blood disorders. This test also helps doctors monitor the effectiveness of chemotherapy or radiation treatment in people with cancer.<br>

• High WBC counts don’t often cause symptoms, although the underlying conditions causing the high count may cause their own symptoms. The symptoms of a low WBC count may prompt your doctor to recommend a WBC count. It’s also normal for doctors to order a CBC and check your WBC count during an annual physical examination.
