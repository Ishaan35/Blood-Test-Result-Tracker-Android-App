• Platelets, also called thrombocytes, are tiny fragments of cells that are essential for normal blood clotting. They are formed from very large cells called megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and are released into the blood to circulate. The platelet count is a test that determines the number of platelets in your sample of blood.

• When there is an injury to a blood vessel or tissue and bleeding begins, platelets help stop bleeding in three ways. They: Adhere to the injury site, Clump together (aggregate) with other platelets, Release chemical compounds that stimulate aggregation of other platelets.
<br>
<br>
• These steps result in the formation of a loose platelet plug at the site of the injury in a process called primary hemostasis. At the same time, activated platelets support the coagulation cascade, a series of steps that involves the sequential activation of proteins called clotting factors. This secondary hemostasis process results in the formation of strands of fibrin that weave through the loose platelet plug, form a fibrin net, and compress to form a stable clot that remains in place until the injury has healed. When the clot is no longer needed, other factors break the clot down and remove it.

<br>
• Each component of the clotting process must be present, activated at the right time, and functioning properly for adequate clotting. If there is an insufficient number of platelets or if the platelets are not functioning normally, a stable clot may not form and you may be at an increased risk of excessive bleeding.

<br>
• Platelets survive in the circulation about 8 to 10 days, so the bone marrow must continually produce new platelets to replace those that degrade, are used up, and/or are lost through bleeding. Determining the number of platelets in blood with a platelet count can help diagnose a range of disorders having to do with too few or too many platelets.

    • A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. Having more than 450,000 platelets is a condition called thrombocytosis; having less than 150,000 is known as thrombocytopenia. You get your platelet number from a routine blood test called a complete blood count (CBC).

    • When you don’t have enough platelets, it’s called thrombocytopenia. Symptoms include easy bruising, and frequent bleeding from the gums, nose, or GI tract. Your platelet count drops when something is preventing your body from producing platelets. There are a wide range of causes, including: Medications, An inherited condition, Certain types of cancer, such as leukemia or lymphoma, Chemotherapy treatment for cancer, Kidney infection or dysfunction, Too much alcohol.

    • The medical term for having too many platelets is thrombocytosis, and there are two types: <b>1. Primary or essential thrombocytosis </b> – Abnormal cells in the bone marrow cause an increase in platelets, but the reason is unknown. <b>2. Secondary thrombocytosis </b> – The same condition as primary thrombocytosis, but may be caused by an ongoing condition or disease such as anemia, cancer, inflammation, or infection.
