• Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a protein in the blood that protects the lungs from damage caused by activated enzymes. Laboratory tests measure the level of AAT in blood or identify abnormal forms of AAT that a person has inherited to help diagnose alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

• AAT helps to inactivate several enzymes, the most important of which is elastase. Elastase is an enzyme produced by white blood cells called neutrophils and is part of the body's normal response to injury and inflammation. Elastase breaks down proteins so that they can be removed and recycled by the body. If its action is not regulated by AAT, elastase will also begin to break down and damage lung tissue.

• Each individual inherits two copies of the gene that codes for AAT. It is called the protease inhibitor (SERPINA1) gene. This gene is co-dominant, which means that each SERPINA1 gene copy is responsible for producing half of the body's AAT. If there is a change or mutation in one or both of the gene copies, then less AAT and/or AAT with reduced function is produced.
<br>
<br>
• When AAT production drops below 30% of normal, the affected person will experience a disorder called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. People with this disorder are at a considerable risk of developing emphysema, a progressive lung disease, in early adulthood. If they smoke or are exposed to occupational dust or fumes, the lung damage tends to occur sooner and be more severe.

• Certain types of dysfunctional AAT accumulate in the liver cells, where it is produced. As AAT builds up in these cells, it forms abnormal protein chains and begins to destroy the cells and damage the liver. About 10% of newborns with AAT deficiency have liver damage and are jaundiced. In severe cases, these infants may require a liver transplant to survive. AAT deficiency is currently the most common genetic cause of liver disease in the pediatric population.
<br>
<br>
• In adults with AAT deficiency, the risk of developing chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) is increased. Few adults with AAT deficiency actually have signs or symptoms of liver disease, however. The amount and function of the AAT depends on the gene mutation that is inherited. While there are more than 120 different alleles in the SERPINA1 gene, only a few are common. Most people in the U.S., about 90%, have two copies of the normal "wild type" M gene (MM). The most common abnormal genes are labeled S and Z.

    • A low level of AAT in blood indicates that the person tested may have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The lower the level of AAT, the greater the risk of developing emphysema and other disorders related to AAT deficiency.

    • Most hospital laboratories report serum alpha1-antitrypsin levels in milligrams per decimeter, with a reference range of approximately 100-300 mg/dL. Levels less than 80 mg/dL suggest a significant risk for lung disease.
