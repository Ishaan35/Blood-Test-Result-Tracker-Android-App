• The Schilling test is a medical procedure used to determine whether you’re absorbing vitamin B-12 properly. Your doctor may choose to order this test if you have vitamin B-12 deficiency, or pernicious anemia. The Schilling test usually involves up to four stages. It also involves analyzing your urine samples to help determine the cause of the vitamin deficiency.<br>

• Your body uses vitamin B-12 to make red blood cells. Anemia is a condition in which your body doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells to transport oxygen to your organs and tissues. The test is designed to measure how well your body absorbs vitamin B-12 from your digestive tract.<br>

• Your doctor may recommend the Schilling test if you have a vitamin B-12 deficiency. The test can help them determine whether your stomach is producing “intrinsic factor.” Intrinsic factor is a type of protein required for vitamin B-12 absorption. Without it, your body will be unable to absorb vitamin B-12, resulting in pernicious anemia.<br>
