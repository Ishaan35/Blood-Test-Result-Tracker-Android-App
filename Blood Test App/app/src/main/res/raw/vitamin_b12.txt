• Vitamin B12 and folate are two vitamins that are part of the B complex of vitamins. B12 and folate work with vitamin C to help the body make new proteins. They are necessary for normal red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) formation, repair of tissues and cells, and synthesis of DNA. Both are nutrients that cannot be produced in the body and must be supplied by the diet.

• Vitamin B12 and folate tests measure vitamin levels in the liquid portion of the blood (serum or plasma) to detect deficiencies. Sometimes the amount of folate inside red blood cells may also be measured. <br>

• Vitamin B12, also called cobalamin, is found in foods from animals, such as red meat, fish, poultry, milk, yogurt, and eggs.

• A deficiency in either B12 or folate can lead to macrocytic anemia, where red blood cells are larger than normal. Megaloblastic anemia, a type of macrocytic anemia, is characterized by the production of fewer but larger RBCs called macrocytes, in addition to some cellular changes in the bone marrow. Other laboratory findings associated with megaloblastic anemia include decreased WBC count, RBC count, reticulocyte count, and platelet count.
