• Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found throughout the body, but it is mostly found in the liver, bones, kidneys, and digestive system.
<br>
<br>
• The enzyme is responsible for removing the phosphate group through a process known as dephosphorylation
<br>
<br>
• When the liver is damaged, ALP may leak into the bloodstream.
<br>
<br>
<br>

• This test is ordered along with a group of other tests called 'liver profile' or 'liver panel'  <br>
 • This test is also recommended if a person is suspected of having liver disease or bone disease  <br><br>
 •  Someone with liver disease may show signs of fatigue, vomiting, loss of appetite, nausea or abdominal swelling and pain<br>
 •  bone disease may show pain in the bones or joints, and increased frequency of fractures of deformed bones<br>

<b> Normal Range: </b>

    • 44-147 IU/L

<br>

<b>Increased </b> levels can indicate:
<br>
<br>
 • Liver damage - ALP levels are high in liver disease <br>
 • Bone disease - Paget's disease or in cancers of the bone <br>
 • Pregnancy can cause temporary increases in ALP levels  <br>
<br>
<br>

<b>Low </b> levels can indicate:
<br>
<br>
 • Can be seen temporarily after blood transfusions <br>
 • Zinc deficiency <br>
 • Hypophosphatasia, a rare genetic disease that affects bones and teeth  <br>
