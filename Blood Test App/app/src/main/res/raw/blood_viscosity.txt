• Blood viscosity is a measure of the thickness and stickiness of your blood. It measures how easily your blood flows through your vessels. It is an indicator of how much friction is being generated between your blood and the walls of your blood vessels, how hard your heart is working to pump your blood, and how easily oxygen is being delivered to your heart, your brain, your muscles, and every other tissue in your body. Blood viscosity affects the health of every part of your body. Best of all, blood viscosity can easily be improved with diet and other lifestyle-based interventions.

• There are five primary determinants of blood viscosity: hematocrit, red blood cell flexibility, plasma viscosity, red blood cell aggregation and sedimentation, and body temperature. Other factors affecting blood viscosity do so by affecting one of these five primary determinants. For example, people with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance have higher blood viscosity than those with normal glucose tolerance.10-11 This is because fluctuating blood sugar decreases the flexibility of red blood cells, the second primary determinant of blood viscosity.

    • In adults, hyperviscosity syndrome typically causes symptoms when blood viscosity is between 6 and 7, measured relative to saline, but it can be lower. Normal values are usually between 1.6 and 1.9. During treatment, the goal is to lower viscosity to the level needed to resolve an individual's symptoms.
