• A triglycerides test measures the amount of triglycerides in your blood. Triglycerides are a type of fat in your body. If you eat more calories than you need, the extra calories are changed into triglycerides. These triglycerides are stored in your fat cells for later use. When your body needs energy, triglycerides are released into your bloodstream to provide fuel for your muscles to work. If you eat more calories than you burn off, especially calories from carbohydrates and fats, you may get high triglyceride levels in your blood. High triglycerides may put you at greater risk for a heart attack or stroke.<br>

• A triglycerides test is usually part of a lipid profile. Lipid is another word for fat. A lipid profile is a test that measures the level of fats in your blood, including triglycerides and cholesterol, a waxy, fatty substance found in every cell of your body. If you have high levels of both LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides, you may be at an increased risk for a heart attack or stroke.
