• Acid Phosphatases (APs) are a family of enzymes present in animal and plant species.
<br>
<br>
• Acid Phosphatase is primarily found in the prostate gland, although it is present in the liver, spleen, and blood cells. These tissues tend to release acid phosphatase in the bloodstream if they are not functioning properly.
<br>
<br>
<br>

• The purpose of the acid phosphatase test is to evaluate te spread of prostate cancer to other parts of the body.
<br>
<br>
• This test does not help identify your risk of prostate cancer before the condition develops.
<br>
<br>
• Cases of hyperthyroidism, Gaucher's disease and some blood cell diseases also see an increased level of the acid phosphatase enzyme. This test can also help analyze dysfunction in the heart or liver.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<b> Reference Range: </b>
<br>
    In adults and elderly persons, the normal findings for acid phosphatase are 0.13-0.63 U/L

<br>
<br>

<b>Increased </b> levels of the enzyme can indicate:
<br>
<br>
 • Kidney disease <br>
 • Prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body <br>
 • Paget's disease <br>
 • Gaucher disease <br>
 • Anemia-low read blood cell count <br>
 • Hyperparathyroidism <br>
