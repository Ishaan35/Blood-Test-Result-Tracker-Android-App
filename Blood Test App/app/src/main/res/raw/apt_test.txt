• This test uses alkali denaturation of fetal hemoglobin to determine if blood is present in the stool of a newborn as a result of swallowing maternal blood or is due to perinatal or neonatal Gastro-intestinal hemorrhage. In swallowed blood syndrome, blood or bloody stools are passed usually on the second or third day of life. The blood may be swallowed during delivery or may be from a fissure of the mother’s nipple. The test is based on the fact that the infant’s blood contains > 60% fetal hemoglobin that is alkali resistant. Swallowed blood of maternal origin contains adult hemoglobin, which is converted to brownish alkaline hematin on the addition of alkali. <br>
