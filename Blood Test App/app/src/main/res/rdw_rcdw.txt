• The red cell distribution width (RDW) blood test measures the amount of red blood cell variation in volume and size.
<br>
<br>

• You need red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to every part of your body. Anything outside of the normal range in red blood cell width or volume indicates a possible problem with bodily function that in turn may affect oxygen getting to various parts of your body.
<br>
<br>
• Normal red blood cells maintain a standard size of 6 to 8 micrometers (µm) in diameter. Your RDW is elevated if the range of sizes is large.
<br>
<br>
• This means that if on average your RBCs are small, but you also have a lot of very small cells, your RDW will be elevated. Similarly, if on average your RBCs are large, but you also have a lot of very large cells, your RDW will be elevated.
<br>
<br>
• For this reason, RDW is not used as an isolated parameter when interpreting a complete blood count (CBC). Rather, it provides shades of meaning in the context of the hemoglobin (hgb) and mean corpuscular value (MCV).
<br>
<br>
• High RDW values may mean you have a nutrient deficiency, anemia, or other underlying condition.
<br>
<br>
• The RDW test is used to help diagnose types of anemia and other medical conditions including: <br> <br>

• thalassemias (which are inherited blood disorders that can cause severe anemia)<br>
• diabetes mellitus<br>
• heart disease<br>
• liver disease<br>
• cancer<br>
<br>

<b> Results: </b>
<br><br>
• A normal range for red cell distribution width is 12.2 to 16.1 percent in adult females and 11.8 to 14.5 percent in adult males. If you score outside this range, you could have a nutrient deficiency, infection, or other disorder. However, even at normal RDW levels, you may still have a medical condition. To receive a proper diagnosis, your doctor must look at other blood tests — such as the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) test, which is also part of a CBC — to combine results and provide an accurate treatment recommendation.
<br><br>

• If your RDW is too high, it could be an indication of a nutrient deficiency, such as a deficiency of iron, folate, or vitamin B-12.
<br><br>
- These results could also indicate macrocytic anemia, when your body doesn’t produce enough normal red blood cells, and the cells it does produce are larger than normal. This can be due to a deficiency of folate or vitamin B-12.
<br>
- Additionally, you may have microcytic anemia, which is deficiency of normal red blood cells, and your red blood cells will be smaller than normal. Iron deficiency anemia is a common cause of microcytic anemia.
<br>
- To help properly diagnose these conditions, your healthcare provider will perform a CBC test and compare the RDW and MCV test portions to measure your red blood cell volume.
